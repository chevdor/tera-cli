tera-cli 0.1.3
chevdor <chevdor@gmail.com>
Command line utility for the tera templating engine. You need to provide a template using the tera
syntax as well as some data (various format are supported)

USAGE:
    tera [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] --template <template> [context]

ARGS:
    <context>    Location of the context data. This file can be of the following type: json |
                 toml | yaml. If you prefer to pass the data as stdin, use `--stdin`

FLAGS:
    -a, --escape               Auto-escape rendered content. This is useful for HTML output
    -e, --env                  If true, the current ENV will be appended to the data under the
                               --env-key key
        --env-first            By default, the context is made of the data you pass and the ENV is
                               applied afterwards. Setting this option will apply the ENV first.
                               This is interesting if you prefer your data to override the ENV
        --env-only             If you want to solely use the ENV as context, you may pass this
                               option. This will prevent an error about no context being passed to
                               be raised
        --fail-on-collision    if you prefer your data to override the ENV
    -h, --help                 Prints help information
    -i, --include              This flag tells the command to parse all templates found in the same
                               path where the given template is located [aliases: inherit]
    -s, --stdin                The context data can be passed using stdin
    -V, --version              Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --env-key <env-key>
            By default, if --env is set, the environment variables will be attached at the root of
            the context. This is convenient but may end up conflicting with your data. To prevent
            collisions, you can provide a custom key with this option

        --include-path <include-path>
            Option to define a different path from which search and parse templates [aliases:
            inherit-path]

    -o, --out <out>                      Optional output file. If not passed, using stdout
    -t, --template <template>            Location of the template
